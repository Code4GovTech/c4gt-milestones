## Screenshots / Videos 

## Contributions
- No PRs because it took a lot of time and study to figure out why inbuilt methods don't work.
## Learnings
1. Eventemitter in Angular : Parent to Child component data transfer
2. Services : Used in the angular to pass the data works among same route component but not across the routes.
3. By learning services, it helped me to provide more abstraction and organise my code in  more modular way.
