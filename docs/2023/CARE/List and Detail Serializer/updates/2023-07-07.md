## Learnings

- I only made one contribution in this period but I feel like that was the biggest barrier in the project and I overcame that. My first PR had a lot of issues, I made some mistakes in the Version Control, didn't write tests etc. 

- After my first PR got approved I knew the rest of the project is going to be better, as I can apply all the learnings from my first PR immediately to my consecutive PRs

- I don't have much knowledge about React and its components. So, I brushed up on the basics of Hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer and Redux and its actions. All these had to be learnt to identify areas in the backend that lead to stale data (**data which was not being used**).
