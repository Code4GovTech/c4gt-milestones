# Project Description

Glific is an open-source 2-way communication platform for NGOs, based on WhatsApp. It allows NGOs to engage in conversations with their community. Glific as a SaaS platform needs an integrated billing and resource usage system to manage its customer base. Our initial integration was with Stripe Subscriptions, but due to Indian Government regulations, the prevalence of e-payments, this is no longer functional. We'd like to take a new look at this and come up with a better integration service ideally with an Indian Payment Processor.
