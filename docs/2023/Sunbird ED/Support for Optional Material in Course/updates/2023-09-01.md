## Milestones
- [x]  Additional material can be a content within a module or all of them can be bundled together as a module.
- [x]  Optional material in trackable collections should not impact users' progress percentage or certificate criteria. For instance, if a course has 3 resources (2 mandatory and 1 optional), certificates should be issued based on the completion of the 2 mandatory resources, regardless of the optional one.
