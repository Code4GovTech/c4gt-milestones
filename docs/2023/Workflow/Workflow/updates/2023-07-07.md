## Milestones
- Initially, I set up the Workflow Project locally:
This milestone refers to the initial setup of the Workflow Project on a local development environment. It likely involves installing the necessary software dependencies, configuring the development environment, and setting up the project structure.

- Then I cloned and installed the pwa-poc repository, which needed to be migrated to Next.js:
In this milestone, the pwa-poc repository is cloned from github and installed locally. The pwa-poc repository is an existing codebase that needs to be migrated to Next.js(version 13).

- I took the rest of the time going through the codebase of pwa-poc and planning how to migrate its pages and components to Next.js:
After cloning and installing the pwa-poc repository, the focus shifts to understanding the existing codebase. This milestone involves thoroughly examining the codebase, including its pages (UI screens) and components (reusable UI elements), to gain a comprehensive understanding of its structure and functionality. The goal is to plan and strategize the migration process to Next.js, which may involve refactoring the existing code, adapting components to Next.js conventions, and optimizing the project's architecture.
