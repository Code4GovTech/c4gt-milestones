ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 1: Understanding how the content detail page works

I started learning about the architecture of the content detail page and the media players which are to be displayed on it, the different players that are used in sunbird ed and how they are integrated into the content detail page. I learned how to work with media files from database and how to render them on the frontend. 

ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 2: Figuring out how to make the content detail page modular

I started thinking of the steps needed to isolate some code from a codebase to make it modular. Thus, I got a deeper understanding of how content detail page is dependent on other parts of the codebase and how one can isolate some code to make it a seperate and independent functionality which can be added to other codebases easily. 

ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 3: Learning the workings of angular as AOT compiled language

I realized that due to caching angular does not show changes made to the codebase even after rebuilding. Thus I gained deeper understanding how AOT compiled languages render pages. I learned how to clear cache and rebuild the codebase to see the changes made to the codebase.
