### Project Description

Doctor Notes in CARE is a feature that allows keeping notes specific to a Patient. The goal of this project is to redesign Doctor Notes to improve its look and feel, as well as the user experience of it.

This can be redesigned keeping the following things in mind:

- Notes should be shown in a chat popup ,expandable to a dedicated page.
- New Notes should work as if they are Chat Notifications.
- All the relevant parties should be notified of a new message.
