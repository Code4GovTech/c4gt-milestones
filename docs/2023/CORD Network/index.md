CORD is a global public utility and trust framework that is designed to address trust gaps, manage transactions and exchange value at scale. It is designed to simplify the management of information, making it easier for owners to control; agencies and businesses to discover, access and use data to deliver networked public services. It provides a transparent history of information and protects it from unauthorized tampering from within or without the system.
