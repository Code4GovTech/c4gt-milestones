# Project Description

This project aims to enhance the iGOT KarmaYogi Platform's capabilities for discovering Training Products, Mentors, and Training Institutes by developing a Common Discovery Protocol. It proposes to achieve this by drawing inspiration from the existing Beckn protocol, which is primarily used in decentralized commerce, and adapting it for the context of decentralized education.

The Common Discovery Protocol will provide a standardized framework for searching and discovering various educational resources within the iGOT KarmaYogi Platform. By leveraging the concepts and principles of the Beckn protocol, it aims to create a seamless and efficient discovery experience for users seeking training opportunities.
