# Project Description
The project aims to harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate question-answering systems based on contextual information. The main challenge we seek to address is enhancing the LLM's ability to provide accurate and concise answers by providing it with relevant context. This context will be selected using a vector Database (to be determined), wherein the top 'n' documents with the highest similarity to the user query will be chosen.

# Project Goals
This project's goal is to establish a robust data ingestion pipeline to populate the selected database with all the relevant information.
