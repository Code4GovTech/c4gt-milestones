## Milestones
- Added the UI for the login and inbox screen
This week my mentor asked me to work on the Inbox page. I took the general inspiration from the React app which is already built. For the basic design and theme, I used the Digit UI package which ended up saving a lot of time and effort. This helped me in focusing more on the Bussiness logic and State Management of the app.
