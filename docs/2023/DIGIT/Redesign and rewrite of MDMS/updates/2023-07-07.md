## Contributions

As my project is built from scratch I dont have any existing repo to push to thus I dont have any PR's.\
But here is what I have worked on for the first week

- Creating a Spring boot CRUD application.
- Connecting a PostgreSQL database to the application
- Learning storing of JSONB data in postgres.

## Learnings

Learned about the requirements of the project and the basic technical building blocks of the project.
