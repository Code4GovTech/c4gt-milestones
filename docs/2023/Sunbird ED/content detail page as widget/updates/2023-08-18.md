ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 1: delevoping the player helper module of the widget

I started working on the most important part of widget, rendering the media player on the content detail page. I made a seperate module which could be added to a page and take the media url or file as input and render the player. I learned how to make a module in angular and how to make it take input from the page it is added to.

ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 2: Testing it for various player formats
Since I added whereas player helpers to make the module display various types of media, I tested it by adding different media as input and checking if it renders the player for that media type. I learned how to test a module and how to test it for various types of inputs.

ðŸŽ¯ Milestone 3: Testing modularity of widget 

I tested the modularity of the widget in sundird ed codebase first, by removing its own code for content detail page and adding my widget to it. I learned how to test modularity of a widget and how to make it work with other codebases.
