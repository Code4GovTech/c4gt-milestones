## Learnings

1. **Temporary Deletion and Data Recovery:**
   - Clicking the "Delete" button results in temporary removal of data.
   - Refreshing the page restores the deleted data, indicating that the deletion is not permanent.

2. **API Interaction for Data Creation:**
   - When clicking "Create," the application stores the new data through an API.
   - This demonstrates the application's ability to interact with the API for data storage.
