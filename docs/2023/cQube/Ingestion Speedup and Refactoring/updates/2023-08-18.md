## Learnings

📝 In case csv with large size is being ingested , an OOM error is thrown . I recognised what the error is and to build an approach to set up memory limit while ingesting files .

📝 Modified the adapter service to incorparate changes such that the global config.json should be overridden in case a config.json is present at a program
level.
