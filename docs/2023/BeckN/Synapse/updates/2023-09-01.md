## Learnings
- OPEN AI API - The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that requires understanding or generating natural language and code. The OpenAI API can also be used to generate and edit images or convert speech into text.

- Documentations - Code documentation is the process through which software programmers document their code. It is a combination of clear pictures and textual explanations that describe what a codebase does and how it may be used.
