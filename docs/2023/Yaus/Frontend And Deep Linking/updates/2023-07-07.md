## Learnings

- In my case the proposed project initially didn't have the frontend codebase. So I had to migrate the frontend codebase from the old repo to the new one. This was a good learning experience as I got to know about the various ways to migrate a codebase from one repo to another. I also learnt about the various ways to handle the dependencies and how to resolve the conflicts.
- Meanwhile I also figured it out that there is a need to refactor the frontend codebase to make it more maintainable and scalable. So I am planning to refactor the frontend codebase in the next week.
