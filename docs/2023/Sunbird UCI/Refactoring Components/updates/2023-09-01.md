## Contributions
This week I closed all the pending tasks and had meetings with my mentor and co-mentee to wrap up the project. I also deployed the documentation of the whole project this week along with my co-mentee who also collaborated on the same. I also worked on my preparation for the final end-point evaluation.  

## Learnings
I learned methods of clear and effective communication with the team and the need for documentation for both the adopters and developers. I also learned how to deploy the whole project on Netlify platform. </br>

**Code for GovTech has been a transformative chapter in my professional life. To say I am thrilled to be part of it would be an understatement. I wish to express my profound gratitude to the organizing team and, most especially, to my mentor. Their support and guidance have been the bedrock on which my contributions stand.**
