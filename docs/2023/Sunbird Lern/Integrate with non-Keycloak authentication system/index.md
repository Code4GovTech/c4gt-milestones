# Project Description

- The User-Org Service of Sunbird Learning Building Block serves as the foundation for user account creation, management, login, and platform administration functionalities. This essential component empowers users to establish accounts, enabling them to personalize platform preferences and gain access to relevant content tailored to their interests. Authenticated users benefit from enhanced platform features, such as Courses and the Learner Passbook.

- Furthermore, the platform administrators are equipped with the necessary capabilities to manage user roles effectively and handle critical platform master data, including Location data and Framework values. The platform's configurability facilitates user logins through various methods, such as username/password, Google login, or single sign-on with approved external systems.

- Currently, UserOrg seamlessly integrates with Keycloak version 7.0.1 for authentication purposes. The objective of this project is to explore alternative authentication systems to replace Keycloak.
