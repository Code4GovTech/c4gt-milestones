## Milestones

- &#x2611; Environment Setup and CAS Integration:

- &#x2192; Set up a development environment that includes Sunbird-Learn User-Org Service and CAS security framework.
- &#x2192; Integrate CAS into the Sunbird-Learn User-Org Service, ensuring seamless authentication and authorization.
- &#x2192; Develop a sample Java web application representing a user-facing interface for testing.

- &#x2611; User Registration and Login Flow:

- &#x2192; Implement user registration and login functionality using CAS for authentication.
- &#x2192; Ensure secure password handling and storage within the Sunbird-Learn User-Org Service.
- &#x2192; Test the registration and login flow with various scenarios, including successful and failed login attempts.

- &#x2611; Password Recovery and Security Features:

- &#x2192; Implement password recovery mechanisms with CAS, including email-based password reset.
- &#x2192; Conduct thorough testing of password recovery and security mechanisms.

- &#x2611; Role-Based Access Control:

- &#x2192; Implement role-based access control (RBAC) within the Sunbird-Learn User-Org Service using CAS attributes.
- &#x2192; Define roles and permissions, and ensure proper authorization checks for different user roles.
- &#x2192; Test RBAC scenarios to verify that users can access appropriate resources based on their roles.

- &#x2611; Documentation and Integration Guidelines:

- &#x2192; Document the integration process, including configuration details and code snippets.

## Learnings

- Understood the intricacies of integrating CAS with a complex application like Sunbird-Learn, including dealing with single sign-on (SSO) configurations and attribute mapping.
- Gained insights into best practices for user authentication, password management, and security features to protect user accounts effectively.
- Learned how to implement role-based access control within an application and leverage CAS attributes for authorization.
- Realized the importance of thorough documentation and knowledge sharing to ensure smooth collaboration among team members and future maintainers of the integration.
