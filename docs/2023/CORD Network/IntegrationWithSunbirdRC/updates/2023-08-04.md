## Milestones

- [x] Setting up of keycloak and other related services

### Milestone 1 : Setting up of keycloak

This week, my major task was to make the system ready for the final task, i.e. anchoring of schemas. In order to anchor schemas, we need to first be able to create schemas in the sunbird rc via backend APIs.For that we need to be an authenticated user and must setup the keycloak configurations precisely. Not only authenticated, but in the keycloak admin console, we also need to update roles and permissions.

## Learnings

- Keycloak based authentication
- Entities, Schemas, Actors in the Sunbird eco system
