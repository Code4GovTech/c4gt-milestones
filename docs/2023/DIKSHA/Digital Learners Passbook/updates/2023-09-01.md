## Learnings

- [x] Learnt how to implement the embedding of Digital Certificates in a PDF file to authenticate a document.
- [x] Learnt to generate QR Codes and use to verify the authentication of a document.
- [x] Learnt how to generate certificates using OpenSSL and combining them with generated private keys.
