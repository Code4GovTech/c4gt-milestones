## Learnings
Got a walkthrough of the codebase and the architecture of the app by mentor, attended meetings for doubts and ideation for POCs. Learned how short polling, long polling and websockets work, also had a hands-on experience with socekt.io and built two rooms for communications between them and tested it.
