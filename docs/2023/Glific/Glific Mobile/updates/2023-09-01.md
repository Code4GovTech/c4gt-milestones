## Learnings

As we approach the conclusion of the C4GT program, I have been focused on finalizing my project by addressing bugs and implementing missing functionality. This week, I had the valuable opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions with my mentor regarding the entire project and my future aspirations. Additionally, I've authored a blog post in which I shared my two-month journey, provided a concise project description, and outlined the project's structure and architecture for prospective contributors.
