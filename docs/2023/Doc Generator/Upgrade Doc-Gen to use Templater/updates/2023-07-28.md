## Milestones

- [x] Test out the RenderService
- [x] Declare Types for the RenderService to ensure typesafety in the codebase when using the RenderService in Doc-Gen

## Approach

Successfully tested out the RenderService to see if its able to render the templates and it works as expected. Also declared the types for the RenderService to ensure that the codebase is typesafe when using the RenderService in Doc-Gen.
And Since it works perfectly we can move to packaging it as a npm module to use as standalone code in Doc-Gen.

## Learnings

- [x] How to test out the Service using Postman for api testing
- [x] Creating a seperate Nest Module with required dependencies which can easily be injected and used.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Start creating a npm package.
- [ ] Import in Doc-Gen and test it out locally before publishing to npm registry.
