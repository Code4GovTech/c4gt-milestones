## Learnings
- Familiarized myself with the latest advancements in the field of Question Answering (QA) and Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining insights into their applications and potential use cases.
- Read Hugging Face Documentation in depth for working with query embeddings and LLM Models. 
- Experimented with transformers and pytorch to find the best method to start coding an Evaluation Script. 
- Detailed project design documentations is very important for smooth planning. 
- Having clarity on project milestones to be achieved before coding is very crucial.
