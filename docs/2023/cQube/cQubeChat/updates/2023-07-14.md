## Milestones

- [x] Create cQube specific prompt to fetch details like related table and prompt to get sql query based
- [x] Create module to get subset of schema from the sql file
- [x] Integrate cQube datasets
- [x] A standalone application (chat interface) that connects to the cQube that allows for querying of data from cQube and returns the response as a table/big number/chart depending on user request.
- [x] An autocomplete to suggest users sample queries that they can do.

## Learnings

- ChatGPT 3 and 3.5 model has a small token limit as compared to ChatGPT 4.0.
- For chatbot the temperature of the models needs to be set in a way such that the results are deterministic.
- The prompt engineering determines how good/bad the result produced by chatGpt will be.
