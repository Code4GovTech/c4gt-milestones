## Learnings

My overall C4GT learning experience was amazing
got to learn from diff mentors 
our project ABDM consist of 3 mentors
the importance of iterative development and continous feedback is important in open source 
learned about Mongodb connections to Springboot 
Learned about PR code reviews 
Learned how to write effective documentation for open source work to be continued by some other folks in future 
Overall technical learning for me was about open source ,git github,api testing Postman,Springboot,Mongodb,RestApi,Webhook,SSH TUNNELS,ngrok,code reviews,CI/CD
