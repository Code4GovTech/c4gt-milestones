## Aim
This project aims to create a more reliable credentials issuance and verification system, leveraging CORD chain and SunbirdRC(registry and credentials). 

## Project Description

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polkadot, CORD refers at once to a network protocol and the
primary federated public network that runs this protocol. CORD is a free and open project, with
the code being placed under a FLOSS license. The project is developed in an open manner
and accepts contributions where ever they are helpful.
The implementation of the CORD Layer-1 Framework (CLF), known as CORD and includes a full
protocol implementation together with API bindings and SDK. CORD is designed to be a
general-purpose blockchain technology stack, neither uniquely for a federated network nor
public/private network operation. This paper nonetheless describes CORD under the context
of a federated network.

In this project, we are more interested on the trust part of the blockchain, and not crypto part of it. The important concepts to focuss on are - Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers.


SunbirdRC(Registry & Credentials) is an electronic registry ecosystem. However one of the drawbacks is it is a centralized one and hence it's not tamper proof. Leveraging the power of CORD, we will be building a more reliable credentials issuance and verification system.



## Features to be implemented

- Integrate ability to anchor schemas through APIs
- Integrate ability to create 'registry' on chain
- Integrate APIs to create credentials, or entries on to this registry
