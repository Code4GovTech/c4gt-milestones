# Project Description
Expose Extensions as a library on maven central
By exposing Extensions as a library would enable developers to seamlessly integrate ODK Collect into their own Android applications as a single gradle dependency. With this module, developers can take advantage of all the powerful features of ODK Collect, while also customizing the app's functionality to meet their specific needs.

Upload to Maven central as soon as code is merged in main branch
Creating github action to upload the library as soon as code is merged to main would allow us to seamlessly update the version of the app without needed to do a lot of leg work.
