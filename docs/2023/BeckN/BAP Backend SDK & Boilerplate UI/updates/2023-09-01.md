## Learnings
During this final week, the required features in the React Native app were finalized and completed, along with improving the code quality for the SDK. Structured documentation for features, setup, and file structure has been created for developers to better understand the project and make use of it. Overall, throughout this program, a CLI tool and a backend architecture were implemented using Node.js, adhering to the Beckn specifications and schema. This architecture enables requests to the Beckn registry and fulfills the discovery stage of a digital commerce transaction. Hence, I was able to achieve proficiency in software development, documentation, and adherence to specifications, which are essential skills for a full-stack developer.
