## Key Learnings
During this week, I gained valuable experience working with Sunbird and implementing a Node.js layer to connect with Sunbird APIs. I created wrapper APIs in JavaScript to streamline the interaction with Sunbird's APIs.

One of the main challenges was handling the logic to include all sources, hierarchies, and file types effectively. I successfully implemented a parser to handle various file types and config schemas to address the complexities of multiple hierarchies and sources.
