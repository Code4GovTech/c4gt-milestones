# Project Description

Sunbird ED is a platform that can be used to deploy scale-ready solutions in the area of learning, capacity building, and professional development. The platform provides capabilities for a user to register and take trainings that are hosted on the platform. The trainings can also have certificates issued. Each learner has a profile that lists all the courses taken by him/her.

This is to extend to integrate Digital Learner Passbook with Sunbird Ed Portal and Mobile Apps. A digital learner passbook will act as a digital profile & docket of a learner wherein it will comprise details of the learner along with all the digitally verifiable credentials and will also capture the skills/competencies that have been achieved by the learner. The verifiable credentials can be issued by different sources, not just the Sunbird ED solution.

**Features to be implemented**
- Integrate the pluggable Digital Learner Passbook in the Profile page of Sunbird ED Portal App.
