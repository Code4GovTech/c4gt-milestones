# Project Description
The HCX JavaScript SDK project aims to develop a Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables seamless integration with the Health Claim Exchange (HCX) protocol. By leveraging JavaScript, the SDK will allow participants to initialize configurations, process incoming requests, and generate outbound requests. This project seeks to enhance interoperability, accuracy, and trustworthiness in health claim information exchange. The completion of the JavaScript SDK will streamline integration processes, improve efficiency, and drive the adoption of HCX.
