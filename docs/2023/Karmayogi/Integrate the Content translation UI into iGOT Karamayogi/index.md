# Project Description
The project involves developing an automated content generation and translation
system integrated with the IGOT (Integrated Government Online Training) Portals. The
system is designed to generate specific types of content based on the
Ministry/Department/Organization and the level/role of the official. Additionally, the
system should support multiple languages as the medium of instruction, allowing users
to select their preferred language.
