## Learnings
    Created a common component which can be used in general by either image/video/audio, which reduces the redundancy in the code and further when it will be brought in use fully it will cut down the code of many components like ckeditor and asset-browser.
    Learned about ckeditor library, advantages of making code more and more dynamic which makes it more reusable
