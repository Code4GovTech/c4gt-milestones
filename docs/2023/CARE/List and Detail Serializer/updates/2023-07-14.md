- [Add home_facility to UserBaseMinimumSerializer #1441](https://github.com/coronasafe/care/pull/1441)

## Learnings

- Improve the List and Detail Serializers requirements, so data that is read only couldn't be updated by the UI.

- One major thing in the CARE project where work is to be done are tests. The test coverage for the existing CARE project is pretty low. 

- For testing the List Serializer and Detail Serializer I need to be careful that only the right amount of data is being returned or not. This was a bit tricky, but after a bit of research I came up with the idea to test them using Enums in Python.

- Enums helped me maintain that the data being returned from the API response is not more or less and is just perfect. This is extremely helpful and very easy to manage. As the API responses change one only needs to update the Enum.
