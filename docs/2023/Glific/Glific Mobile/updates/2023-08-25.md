## Learnings

During this week, my focus was on enhancing the scalability of the application as we approach the final project phase. I gained valuable insights into optimizing the app, including:

- Efficiently managing a large number of subscriptions, allowing us to receive 1000+ messages per second.
- The significant impact of data reduction on performance improvements.
- Strategies to avoid redundant data and unnecessary API calls.
