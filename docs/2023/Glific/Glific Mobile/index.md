# Project Description

Glific is an open-source 2-way communication platform for NGOs, based on WhatsApp. It allows NGOs to engage in conversations with their community. The project's objective is to develop an iOS/Android application using React Native. This application will enable NGO staff members to conveniently check and communicate with their beneficiaries through their mobile devices.
