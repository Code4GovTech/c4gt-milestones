## Learnings
1. Temporary Deletion and Data Recovery:
     - Clicking the "Delete" button results in temporary removal of data.
     - Refreshing the page restores the deleted data, indicating that the deletion is not permanent.

2. API Interaction for Data Creation:
     - When clicking "Create," the application stores the new data through an API.
     - This demonstrates the application's ability to interact with the API for data storage.
