# Project Description
Most projects need a "master database" of Indian locations - Villages, Districts, States, PIN codes etc. Almost each project reinvents it, and they also need to invest in finding the data from a trusted source, eg: Post office or LGD data. I'm proposing creating a solution using registries that is able to provide all such master APIs.
